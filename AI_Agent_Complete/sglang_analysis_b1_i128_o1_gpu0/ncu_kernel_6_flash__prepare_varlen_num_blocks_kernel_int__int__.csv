Whenever possible, try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. If the block size is 512 threads or greater, consider splitting it into smaller groups. This can increase eligible warps without affecting occupancy, unless shared memory becomes a new occupancy limiter.

Whenever possible, try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. If the block size is 512 threads or greater, consider splitting it into smaller groups. This can increase eligible warps without affecting occupancy, unless shared memory becomes a new occupancy limiter.
